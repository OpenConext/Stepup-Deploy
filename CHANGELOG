* Make the default locale and the available locales for the stepup applications configurable using group_vars.
  See the playbook variables "default_locale" and "enabled_locales" in group_vars/all.yml. These two variables
  must be added to existing environments.
* Add "lb_addresses" in group_vars/all.yml. When using a load balancer, set this variable to an array of IP addresses
  of the loadbalancers. Used in nginx config and default ip(6)tables config.

Release 13.1 (hotfix)
Hotfix for matching case-insensitive identifiers

Install:
* Deploy component

Release 13
Bugfix release solving two issues:
- fix an issue with pushing institution config changes, which was broken in release 12
- fix an issue with determining an institution-specific LoA for unknown users

In addition, Kibana log retention is extended from 90 to 120 days.

Install:
* Deploy components:
  - Gateway 2.7.2
  - Middleware 2.6.4
  - RA 2.7.1

* run manage role (for manage_keep_logs_days)
  ansible-playbook site.tyml -i <inventory> -t manage -l <host>


Release 12
Add support for the SFO extension for Microsoft ADFS (https://github.com/SURFnet/ADFS-MFA-SAML2.0-Extension) to the
Setup-Gateway

* Gateway
- Add support for receiving SAML AuthnRequests using the the HTTP-POST binding
- When the ADFS specific "AuthMethod" and "Context" are present the SFO endpoint will switch to "SFO extension for ADFS"
  mode:
  - It adds "AuthMethod" and "Context" HTTP POST variables from the request to the response
  - It returns the SAMLResponse in a HTTP POST variable "_SAMLResponse" instead of "SAMLResponse"

* Deploy
- "app" role: Added "lb_addresses" variable to specify trusted IPs for the X-Forwarded-For header. Stopped using hosts
  from lb group for this purpose as the lb role is going to be removed from the playbook. If you are using the lb role
  you should set "lb_addresses" variable add redeploy the app role.

Install:
* Deploy components:
  - Gateway 2.7.0

* Rerun app role (for lb_addresses)
  ansible-playbook site.yml -i <inventory> -t app -l <host>


Release 11
Fix for per institution LoA configuration, add GSSP though configuration, update Swiftmailer because of CVE-2016-10074,
show error when missing EPTI attribute.

* Gateway
- Fix: Update swiftmailer because of CVE-2016-10074. Exploitation requires the attacker to control the email address.
- Fix: Per IdP LoA configuration for an SP by institution ID. Institution ID's are now recognised in the loa definition of
  an SP as described in https://github.com/OpenConext/Stepup-Middleware/blob/master/docs/MiddlewareConfiguration.md#service-providers
- Fix: The gateway would generate a SAML Assertion without a Subject when the Assertion from the remote IdP did not
  contain a eduPersonTargetedID attribute with a NameID. Now an error is shown on the gateway when this occurs.

* Middleware, Gateway, SelfService and RA
- A new GSSP can be though configuration. The Ansible environment must be updated:
  - A new parameter "stepup_enabled_generic_second_factors" was introduced
  - The "stepup_enabled_factors" parameter was updated
  When using the existing GSSPs "tiqr" and "biometric", the changes are minimal. The requied changes are described in
  docs/add-gssf-to-stepup.md

Install:
* Deploy components:
  - Middleware 2.6.0
  - Gateway 2.6.0
  - RA 2.7.0
  - SelfService 2.7.0

  - RA 2.6.1
  - Tiqr 1.1.5


Release 9
Limit token types per institution, AuthnRequest signature validation error bug,
Mixed case schacHomeOrganization bug

* The repositories were moved from the GitHub SURFnet organization to the OpenConext organization

* Middleware:
  - Fix: Error when applying an institution configuration when to institution is using a mixed case
    schacHomeOrganization
  - The institution configuration now requires an "allowed_second_factors" option. This option can be used
    limit the available token types

* Gateway:
  - Security: Use HTTPS instead of HTTP when validating a yubikey challenge at the Yubico validation service.
    This makes validation more robust against attacks on the message signatures.
  - Fix: Mishandeling of the URL encoding of SAML AuthnRequests causes valid signatures to be considered
    invalid by the Gateway

* SelfService interface:
  - The available token types that a user can select can be limited on a per institution basis

Install:
* Deploy components:
  - Middleware 2.4.0
  - Gateway 2.4.2
  - SelfService 2.5.0

    "template/middleware/middleware-config.json.j2"

* RA interface:
  - Fix: sorting the audit log fails for some fields
  - Fix: no error message was shown when a user with an expired registration code was vetted
  - Fix: RA's could vet users belonging to other institutions
  - Added help text under the search box in the "Token Activation" screen
  - Limited input in the document number field to 6 characters
  - Remove text 'optional' in tokens screen
  - The Manual link URL in the footer is now per language and must be set through "ra_manual_url" in
    "stepup-ra.yml"
  - Check the Issuer in the SAML Response. It must matches the saml_remote_idp_entity_id set in "paramters.yml"

* Selfservice interface:
  - Help link URL in the footer is now per language and must be set through "ss_support_url" in
    "stepup-selfservice.yml"
  - Check the Issuer in the SAML Response. It must matches the saml_remote_idp_entity_id set in "paramters.yml"

Install:
* Deploy components
  - Middleware 2.3.1
  - Selfservice 2.3.0
  - RA 2.4.0
  

Release 7
RA Locations, Institution configuration, Server-side session expiry

* Added per institution configuration through the middleware API of the way the RA location are shown to users in the
  selfservice interface and email.
  - The RAA contacts can be hidden, so only RA contacts are shown. Defaults to old behaviour (show both RA and RAA contacts)
  - Instead of RA(A) contacts RA locations can be shown. When enabled the RAA of an institution can edit the list of the
    RA locations through the RA interface. Defaults to old behaviour (show RA(A) contacts)
  - Added an institution configuration for enabling/disabling the above two options. Configuration though the template
    in <inventory>/templates/middleware/middleware-institution.json
    See https://github.com/SURFnet/Stepup-Middleware/blob/2.1.0/README.md for configuration format
  - The email template for 'registration_code' in middleware-config.json.j2 is replaced by 'registration_code_with_ras'
    and 'registration_code_with_ra_locations'.
    See https://github.com/SURFnet/Stepup-Middleware/blob/2.1.0/README.md for configuration format
* Added server side session timeouts based on absolute (since login) and relative (since last client interaction with the
  server) through "app_session_max_duration" and "app_session_expiry_time" group_vars.
* RA interface changes
  - Show the document number in the tokens overview in the RA interface (requires event replay)
  - The time in the audit log is now shown in the timezone configured in the webbrowser instead of in UTC
* The Selfservice, RA and Gateway now set/update a HTTP cookie named "stepup_locale" with the current known preferred
  locale of the user. The domain for which the cookie is set is configured through the "locale_cookie_domain" group_var.
* Various minor UI layout fixes/improvements.
* Fix: middleware:event:replay may fail with Middleware < 2.1.0.
* tiqr fixes
  - solves a problem with iOS10 devices
  - small layout en translation improvements

Install:

* Replay eventlog
  - Prevent changes during the replay by taken middleware offline (or take the SS and RA offline)
  - Change to middleware directory (e.g. /opt/www/middleware.example.org)
  - Run "php app/console middleware:event:replay --env=prod_event_replay" on an app server
    The replay runs in a single database transaction. It replays all events en recreates the projections. This may take
    some time depending on the number of events in the events table.
