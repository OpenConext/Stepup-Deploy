Deploy
* Environment images can now be set per environment.
  - Put environment specific images in the <environment>/files/stepup-app/images/ directory. These images are uploaded
    to the web/images direcory of each component.
  - Stepup components use the image named "header-logo.png" from the web/images direcory as their logo
* New GSSP methods can be added though configuration. This intoduces several changes to the configuration of existing
  environments. Existing environments must be updated:
  - The GSSP proxy of the Stepup-Gateway now uses the same IdP and SP certificates for all GSSP methods. The variables
    gateway_gssp_sp_privatekey, gateway_gssp_sp_publickey, gateway_gssp_idp_privatekey, gateway_gssp_idp_privatekey,
    ra_gssp_sp_privatekey, ra_gssp_sp_publickey, selfservice_gssp_sp_privatekey and selfservice_gssp_sp_publickey
    replace the per method (e.g. gateway_tiqr_sp_privatekey) variables.
  - A configuration for the tiqr GSSP as well as a second (commented out) "example_gssp" GSSP method configuration is
    provided in the environments/template. Please refer to these to see how to update the GSSP configuration.
* Added optional sendmail_smarthost_port to specify the port on the sendmail_smarthost to use
* Added gateway_support_url and tiqr_support_url
* Completely overhauled the Stepup-Tiqr component. This introduces: tiqr_secret, tiqr_support_url, tiqr_info_url and
  tiqr_info_name in the tiqr.yml group_vars which must be configured before deploying the new tiqr.
* In the institution configuration the maximum number of tokens that can be registerd is set on a per institution bases
  using "number_of_tokens_per_identity"
* Development
  - Allow deployment of components from source

            and sendmail messages

Important changes - attention required:

* Verify configured ACS locations for ADFS service providers in middleware-config before deployment
  - The ACS URL sent by ADFS in the AuthnRequest is now validated by matching it against one or more configured
    allowed ACS locations in the service provider configuration in middleware. The beginning of the ACS URL must
    start with one of the configured values.
* New required configuration parameter in Gateway:
  - new parameters.yml parameter `app_name` (example values: "Stepup Gateway", "SURFsecureID Gateway")
* Dropped configuration parameter in SelfService:
  - the parameters.yml parameter `number_of_tokens_per_identity` can be removed from SelfService,
    in Middleware, the parameter is still required

Install:
* Deploy components:
  - Stepup-Middleware: 2.8.2
  - Stepup-Gateway: 2.9.2
  - Stepup-SelfService: 2.9.2
  - Stepup-RA: 2.9.2
  - Stepup-tiqr: 2.0.1

* Update middleware database schema to 20180409100948 (from 20180330094402)
  - On an app server run "/root/01-middleware-db_migrate.sh" to update the middleware schema.
    Replay of the event log is not required, nor desired.
    The new middleware, selfservice and RA require the new database schema to work. The new gateway works
    with the schema of the previous release.

* Redeploy the app role
  - Run "ansible-playbook site.yml -t app -i <environment>/inventory" to deploy only the app role
    This is required for the new Tiqr to work.
    The new Tiqr requires a different nginx configuration than the old one.

* Redeploy the common role with the rsyslog tag
  - Run "ansible-playbook site.yml -t rsyslog -i <environment>/inventory" to update only the rsyslog configuration
    This enables rsyslog stats and mark modules and lowers the RELP reconnect time

* Redeploy the manage role with the logstash tag
  - Run "ansible-playbook site.yml -t logstash -i <environment>/inventory" to update only the logstash configuration
    This enables additional parsing of log messages


Release 14
Export RA token overview, add GSSP tokens though configuraton, registration code expiry reminder emails support for
multiple tokens per user (experimental)

* Allow multiple tokens per user (experimental). Tokens must be of a different type. I.e when set to 2, a user could
  register a Tiqr token and a yubiKey token, but not two YubiKey tokens or two Tiqr tokens.
  This is a global setting that is configured though 'number_of_tokens_per_identity' in group_vars/all.yml. Setting this
  to "1" retains pre Release 14 behaviour. This variable must be added to existing environments.
* Email verification can be disabled on a per institution basis in the middleware-institution config.
  (https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/153358379)
  - A new mandatory configuration option "verify_email" was added to the institution configuration. Set to "true" to
    keep the pre Release 14 behaviour. This option must be added to the institution config of existing environments.
  - During registration a user can print and/or download a pdf of the registration code confirmation email.
* Make the default locale and the available locales for the stepup applications configurable using group_vars.
  See the playbook variables "default_locale" and "enabled_locales" in group_vars/all.yml. These two variables
  must be added to existing environments.
* Removed the lb role. Added "lb_addresses" in group_vars/all.yml. When using a load balancer, set this variable to an
  array of IP addresses of the loadbalancers. Used in nginx config and default ip(6)tables config.
* The middleware-config in template environment now reads the email templates from separate files to make
  editing of email templates easier.
* Improved handling of expiry of the registration code:
  - When a registration code is expired, the RA shown an error immediately after entering the expired
    registration code.
  - Added "second_factor_verification_reminder_with_ra_locations" and "second_factor_verification_reminder_with_ras"
    email templates. Existing environments must be updated to add these templates
    These two new templates are used by the new "middleware:cron:email-reminder" console command.
    (https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/90086932)
  - The date at which the registration code expires is available as "expirationDate" is the
    registration_code_with_* email templates and in the newly added second_factor_verification_* email
    templates (https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/90086996)
* RA token page improvements:
  - Show totals on token page (https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/152075386)
  - Export to CSV (https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/153357335)
* Allow generic SAML stepup providers (GSSP) to be added though configuration
* Add /health and /info endpoints to the applications, except tiqr (https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/133514143)
* Bug fixes:
  - The gateway now allows any attribute to be passed though the gateway
    (https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/156264642)
  - Fix: "Unknown Generic SAML Stepup Provider requested on gateway after tiqr registration from selfservice"
    (https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/155774630)
  - Fix alignment of SMS send and cancel buttons
    (https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/151327094)
  - Fix: "verify identity" button not working in small browser window
    (https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/144698163)

Release 12
Add support for the SFO extension for Microsoft ADFS (https://github.com/SURFnet/ADFS-MFA-SAML2.0-Extension) to the
Setup-Gateway

* Gateway
- Add support for receiving SAML AuthnRequests using the the HTTP-POST binding
- When the ADFS specific "AuthMethod" and "Context" are present the SFO endpoint will switch to "SFO extension for ADFS"
  mode:
  - It adds "AuthMethod" and "Context" HTTP POST variables from the request to the response
  - It returns the SAMLResponse in a HTTP POST variable "_SAMLResponse" instead of "SAMLResponse"

* Deploy
- "app" role: Added "lb_addresses" variable to specify trusted IPs for the X-Forwarded-For header. Stopped using hosts
  from lb group for this purpose as the lb role is going to be removed from the playbook. If you are using the lb role
  you should set "lb_addresses" variable add redeploy the app role.

Install:
* Deploy components:
  - Gateway 2.7.0

* Rerun app role (for lb_addresses)
  ansible-playbook site.yml -i <inventory> -t app -l <host>


Release 11
Fix for per institution LoA configuration, add GSSP though configuration, update Swiftmailer because of CVE-2016-10074,
show error when missing EPTI attribute.

* Gateway
- Fix: Update swiftmailer because of CVE-2016-10074. Exploitation requires the attacker to control the email address.
- Fix: Per IdP LoA configuration for an SP by institution ID. Institution ID's are now recognised in the loa definition of
  an SP as described in https://github.com/OpenConext/Stepup-Middleware/blob/master/docs/MiddlewareConfiguration.md#service-providers
- Fix: The gateway would generate a SAML Assertion without a Subject when the Assertion from the remote IdP did not
  contain a eduPersonTargetedID attribute with a NameID. Now an error is shown on the gateway when this occurs.

* Middleware, Gateway, SelfService and RA
- A new GSSP can be though configuration. The Ansible environment must be updated:
  - A new parameter "stepup_enabled_generic_second_factors" was introduced
  - The "stepup_enabled_factors" parameter was updated
  When using the existing GSSPs "tiqr" and "biometric", the changes are minimal. The requied changes are described in
  docs/add-gssf-to-stepup.md

    schacHomeOrganization
  - The institution configuration now requires an "allowed_second_factors" option. This option can be used
    limit the available token types

* Gateway:
  - Security: Use HTTPS instead of HTTP when validating a yubikey challenge at the Yubico validation service.
    This makes validation more robust against attacks on the message signatures.
  - Fix: Mishandeling of the URL encoding of SAML AuthnRequests causes valid signatures to be considered
    invalid by the Gateway

Release 7
RA Locations, Institution configuration, Server-side session expiry

* Added per institution configuration through the middleware API of the way the RA location are shown to users in the
  selfservice interface and email.
  - The RAA contacts can be hidden, so only RA contacts are shown. Defaults to old behaviour (show both RA and RAA contacts)
  - Instead of RA(A) contacts RA locations can be shown. When enabled the RAA of an institution can edit the list of the
    RA locations through the RA interface. Defaults to old behaviour (show RA(A) contacts)
  - Added an institution configuration for enabling/disabling the above two options. Configuration though the template
    in <inventory>/templates/middleware/middleware-institution.json
    See https://github.com/SURFnet/Stepup-Middleware/blob/2.1.0/README.md for configuration format
  - The email template for 'registration_code' in middleware-config.json.j2 is replaced by 'registration_code_with_ras'
    and 'registration_code_with_ra_locations'.
    See https://github.com/SURFnet/Stepup-Middleware/blob/2.1.0/README.md for configuration format
* Added server side session timeouts based on absolute (since login) and relative (since last client interaction with the
  server) through "app_session_max_duration" and "app_session_expiry_time" group_vars.
* RA interface changes
  - Show the document number in the tokens overview in the RA interface (requires event replay)
  - The time in the audit log is now shown in the timezone configured in the webbrowser instead of in UTC
* The Selfservice, RA and Gateway now set/update a HTTP cookie named "stepup_locale" with the current known preferred
  locale of the user. The domain for which the cookie is set is configured through the "locale_cookie_domain" group_var.
* Various minor UI layout fixes/improvements.
* Fix: middleware:event:replay may fail with Middleware < 2.1.0.
