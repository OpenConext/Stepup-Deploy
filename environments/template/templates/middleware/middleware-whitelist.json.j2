# This template is used to generate the middleware-whitelist
#
# For more information see:
# https://github.com/OpenConext/Stepup-Middleware/blob/master/docs/MiddlewareConfiguration.md#using-the-whitelist-api
#
# To apply changes made here you need to push a new insitution whitelist to Stepup-Middleware component
# on an app server. There are two ways to do this:
# 1) Use the push-config.sh script in the Stepup-Deploy repo
# 2) Redeploy the Stepup-Middleware component using the deploy.sh script in the Stepup-Deploy repo and then
#    on the app sever execute /root/04-middleware-whitelist.sh
