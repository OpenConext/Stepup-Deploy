Feature: Use case A: Institutions with few (10-20) users using a third party vetting service
  For institutions with few users that are using Stepup, for which setting up and maintaining a local vetting
  structure is relatively expensive, we want to allow a third party to do the vetting whereby the RA's
  are associated with this third party.

  Scenario: Setup of the institution configuration and test users
     Given I have the payload
