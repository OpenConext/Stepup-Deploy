Feature: Use case B: Institutions sharing vetting locations
  Allow users from institutions that cannot easily visit the vetting location at the institution, e.g. because
  they work remotely or abroad, to use the RA services of another institution that is closer to their location. By
  pooling the RAs from different geographical locations, the access for users to RA services is improved.
