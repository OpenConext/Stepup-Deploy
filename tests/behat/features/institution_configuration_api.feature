Feature: A management user reads and writes institution configuration in the middleware API
  In order to configure institutions
  As an application management user
  I must be able to read/write institution configuration to the middleware API

  Scenario: Management user reads the current institution configuration before updating the FGA settings
    Given I authenticate to the Middleware API
    When I request "GET /management/institution-configuration"
    Then the api response status code should be 200
    And institute "institution-a.example.com" has a property "use_ra" which equals 'null'
    And institute "institution-a.example.com" has a property "use_raa" which equals 'null'
    And institute "institution-a.example.com" has a property "select_raa" which equals 'null'

  Scenario: Management user posts a new institution configuration for institution-a.example.com
    Given I have the payload
      """
      {
        "institution-a.example.com": {
          "use_ra_locations": true,

        }
      }
      """
    And I authenticate to the Middleware API
    When I request "POST /management/institution-configuration"
